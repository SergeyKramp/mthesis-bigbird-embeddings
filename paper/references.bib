We combine several approaches into an ensemble, based on spelling error features, a simple neural network using word representations, a deep residual network using word and character features, and a system based on a recurrent neural network. Our best system is an ensemble of neural networks, reaching an F1 score of 0.8323. Although our system is not the highest ranking one, we do outperform the baseline by far.}

We submitted the results achieved by using three different system architectures; each of them combines multiple supervised learning models trained on various feature sets. As expected, better results are achieved with the systems that use both the textual data and the spoken responses. Combining the input data of two different modalities led to a rather dramatic improvement in classification performance. Our best performing method is based on a set of feed-forward neural networks whose hidden-layer outputs are combined together using a softmax layer. We achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.9257 on the evaluation (unseen) test set and our team placed first in the main task together with other three teams.}

From a traditional machine learning perspective,NLI is usually framed as a multi-class classification task, where numerous designed features are combined in order to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We introduce a deep generative language modelling (LM) approach to NLI, which consists in fine-tuning a GPT-2 model separately on texts written by the authors with the same L1, and assigning a label to an unseen text based on the minimum LM loss with respect to one of these fine-tuned GPT-2 models. Our method outperforms traditional machine learning approaches and currently achieves the best results on the benchmark NLI datasets.}

    abstract  = {The paper explores how an attention-based approach can increase performance on the task of native-language identification (NLI), i.e., to identify an author{'}s first language given information expressed in a second language. Previously, Support Vector Machines have consistently outperformed deep learning-based methods on the TOEFL11 data set, the de facto standard for evaluating NLI systems. The attention-based system BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was first tested in isolation on the TOEFL11 data set, then used in a meta-classifier stack in combination with traditional techniques to produce an accuracy of 0.853. However, more labelled NLI data is now available, so BERT was also trained on the much larger Reddit-L2 data set, containing 50 times as many examples as previously used for English NLI, giving an accuracy of 0.902 on the Reddit-L2 in-domain test scenario, improving the state-of-the-art by 21.2 percentage points.}
