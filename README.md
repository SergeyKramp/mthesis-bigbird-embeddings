## Overview

## TLDR
In this work we used embeddings from a fine-tuned Big Bird _(Zaheer et al., 2020)_ model to perform Native Language Identification (NLI) on the Reddit L2 dataset.
Here you will find the code used to sample the data, script used for fine-tuning Big Bird, and notebooks containing the experiments described in the paper. 

What you will not find in this repository is the data used. You can download the Reddit L2 dataset [here](http://cl.haifa.ac.il/projects/L2/) (it appears as __Reddit-L2 chunks__).
